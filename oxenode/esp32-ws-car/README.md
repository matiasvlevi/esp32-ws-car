# esp32-ws-car

This is an [Oxenode](https://oxenode.io/) plugin.

Oxenode is a General Purpose Reactive Scripting Interface. You can build visual scripts and introduce your own custom blocks.

This is what i've done here. We are using the prepackaged `oxenode-std-*` plugins, but we are also using this `esp32-ws-car` plugin.

Since the plugin is specific to this particular esp32 car prototype, it is not part of the oxenode standard library.
